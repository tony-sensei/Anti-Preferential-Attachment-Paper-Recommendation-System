# Project Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your desired folder, and run:
   
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   Run the following commands:
   
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:
   - **For Windows**:
   
   ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
     
   - **For macOS/Linux**:
   
   ```
     source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Once you have the virtual environment activated, install the required packages by running:
   
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install all the necessary packages, including the Neo4j Python driver, and any other dependencies for the project.

4. **Run the application**:
   Follow the specific instructions in the project documentation to run the application.

5. **Deactivating the virtual environment** (optional):
   Once done, you can deactivate the virtual environment with:
   
   ```
   deactivate
   ```
